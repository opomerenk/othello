	Cloning Olivia's Git repository
	Coding random AI and heuristic AI (we did this together side-by-side)
	Debugging code (again, we did this together)

We came up with the numbers to use in our heuristic to try to maximize the
effectiveness of our AI. Rather than just making all the central squares the
same value, we made them slightly different from each other to make
the heuristic slightly better. 

We altered the heuristic slightly in part 2 of the assignment in an
effort to make it more effective. We also fixed a seg fault that was
causing our old AI problems at the end of the games.

We thought about potentially going further and making a Monty 
solution to the problem, but realized that would be too computationally
intensive and so we dropped the idea.
